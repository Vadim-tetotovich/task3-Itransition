# hmac-js
A simple implementation of HMAC token generation and validation.

```sh
npm install hmac-js
```
or
```sh
yarn add hmac-js
```

# Getting Started
This package needs some args:
* algorithm (string): can be **sha256** or **sha512**;
* secret (string): your app secret key;
* payload (string): any data that you want;
* timestamp  (integer): a valid timestamp;

In **verifyHash** method you can add an extra param, the ttl (hash life time). By default it is 30 seconds.

```js
const Hmac = require('hmac-js');

const timestamp = new Date().getTime();

const hash = Hmac.generateHash({
  algorithm: "sha512",
  secret: "mysecret",
  payload: "mypayload",
  timestamp,
});

const isValidHash = Hmac.verifyHash(hash, {
  algorithm: "sha512",
  secret: "mysecret",
  payload: "mypayload",
  timestamp,
});

if (isValidHash) {
  console.log("This is a valid hash");
} else {
  console.log("This is an invalid hash");
}
```

# That's all folks!
Simple as everything should be.
